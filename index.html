  <p>
    African cuisine is a vibrant tapestry of flavors, ingredients, and culinary
    traditions that reflect the continent’s rich cultural diversity. From the
    spicy stews of West Africa to the aromatic tagines of North Africa, each
    region offers its own distinct dishes shaped by history, geography, and
    local produce. With influences from indigenous practices, colonial history,
    and trade routes, African dishes are as varied as the languages spoken
    across the continent.
